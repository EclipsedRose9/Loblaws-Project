# Loblaws-Project
A code I devolved for the Canadian company Loblaws, my task was to create a protype of a new idea they were devopling in house, a program with an automatic calendar system that would assist employees on what to release on what days.


The program has a list of all days for that year, dispalyed with tkinter, and each day was a button that when pressed would display company information for that day (what kind of relase week)
A simple program but my first paid work

The code in its current state will not work, the code checks the current date and time to display which dates work (dates that are in the past are no longer valid buttons) o running the code now would result in just a bunch of dead buttons, to sue this coide you will need to change your the date and time on your system or maniulate python to give you the results you want. Ths file aslo used the company logo within the code to display, I wont incldude this myself so its bets to remove any dependencies on images
